# Coding-Assignment
Assignment project

## About the assignment
The assignment had two problem statements, and both of the problems were related to trie data structure. The assignement solution had to be written in C++.

1. Parse a dictionary (in CSV format) which contains words along with their occurrence frequencies. This trie data structure's object instance should be serialized so that later search operations can be directly performed on this trie data structure rather than building it again and again from the original CSV file.

2. A dictionary of words is given, with all the words indexed from 0 to `N` (where `N` is the total number of words present in the dictionary). Store these words in a trie data structure so that a search operation can be performed on the index which will return the actual word itself.

## How to compile & run the assignment?
Clone the repository and move to project's root directory:
g++ -o ReverseSearch.out ReverseSearch.cpp
g++ -o FindtheWord.out FindtheWord.cpp

1. For running ReverseSearch
 use ./ReverseSearch.out

2. For running FindtheWord
3. use ./FindtheWord.out
